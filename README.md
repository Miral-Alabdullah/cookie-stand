# cookie-stand

**What are you going to find over here?** 

>> This project about a cookies shop that exists in five different locations.

>> This shop opens at 6:00 AM and closed at 7:00 PM. 14 hours of working.

>> During the operation hours, we went to know the number of sales for each shop in each location provided by the owner per hour.

>> Then, we have to see the total number of sales per day individually.
